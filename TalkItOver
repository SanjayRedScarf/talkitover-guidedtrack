*header: Welcome to TIO! :-)

TIO stands for Talk It Over -- this is a place where you can talk about whatever is on your mind.

This is a very early prototype! Thank you for trying it.

If you're feeling low, type what's on your mind and I'll listen to you :-)

I'm not a very clever piece of software and I might not understand everything you say, but I'm here for you for as long as you need. And I won't judge you. So if you think that talking things through with someone in a safe confidential space might help, have a go.


*question: Let's start with you just rating how you feel on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is terrible and 10 is great. Just move the slider to get to the right answer
	*type: slider
	*before: Terrible
	*after: Great
	*save: initialHappinessScore
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
	7
	8
	9
	10
	

*if: initialHappinessScore > 8
	Seems like you're feeling okay!
	I'm here to help people who are feeling low or have something on their minds. But you're feeling good, which is great!

	Why don't you go out and have fun! Or if you want to help others who are feeling low, check out these [google search results|https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=volunteering+opportunities+near+me+mental+health+sane+mind+rethink+samaritans&oq=volunteering+opportunities+near+me+mental+health+sane+mind+rethink+samaritans&aqs=chrome..69i57.10476j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8] to find some volunteering opportunities.
	
	Or maybe you're just here to check out this site, which is cool. Why don't you try again, but pretend you're feeling sad this time! :-) (you can probably do this clicking on Ctrl+r, but don't trust anything I say, I'm just a pretty unintelligent piece of software!)

So let me be totally honest: I'm a pretty simple piece of software. So please do keep talking to me, but I'm afraid I won't do a very good job of understanding. 

Instead think of this as being more like writing a journal, but as you keep writing, I'll be here to encourage you to keep talking.  
*question: Are you still OK to talk with me, even though I'm only simple?
	Yes, I'll talk with you, even though you're only a simple piece of software

We offer a confidential, anonymised service.

You remain anonymous by using this -- we don't have any way of tracking you down, knowing who you are, or linking what you write to you.

If you select the *"anonymous"* option, our boffins may see your text to help us improve the way this software works, but you'll remain anonymous.

If you choose the *"confidential"* option, your text won't be stored at all, and no human will see what you write. (And anything you have written until now has also been deleted before any person sees it)

No matter what you choose, if you say that you're unsafe nobody will be able to act on that information, so use this space to explore your thoughts, not to seek emergency assistance. 

*question: Would you like to use the anonymous or the confidential version of this bot?
	Anonymous - nobody will be able to link your words to you, and your words may help us to improve the service
	Confidential - your text will be immediately deleted
	*save: confidentialityPreference
	
*if: confidentialityPreference = "Anonymous - nobody will be able to link your words to you, and your words may help us to improve the service"
	>> shortConfidentialityPreference = "Anonymous"

	
*if: confidentialityPreference = "Confidential - your text will be immediately deleted"
	>> shortConfidentialityPreference = "Confidential"



OK we've taken a note of that.

You remember saying how you felt on scale from 1 to 10 at the start? I'd like to ask you the same thing at the end so I know if we're helping.

When you're finished using the bot, please type "stop" in the text field where the responses go, this will take you to the super-quick final survey. Please please do this, because we want to know if we are helping.

*question: Do you agree to fill in the quick, one-question survey by writing "stop" in the text field
	Yes, I agree to fill in the quick survey at the end. I'll type "stop" in a text field rather than closing the window.

*question: OK, so you told how you're feeling on a scale from 1 to 10, and you've told me how long you've been feeling this way. Now, perhaps you could start telling me about what's on your mind. Just use this as a space to explore your thoughts -- I'm just here to listen.
